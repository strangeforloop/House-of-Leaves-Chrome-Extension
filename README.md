# House-of-Leaves-Chrome-Extension
This chrome extension aims to extend a sense of verisimilitude to the book House of Leaves by bringing a feature of the book, the word "house" occurring in ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) blue, off the page and into our digital lives.
</br>

# My Motivation
When the extension is enabled, all occurences of the word house on any webpage will be blue.
<br/>
The aim is to catch people off guard and bring back the sense of being encompassed by the book's reality.
<br/>
The technical focus of this project is to do DOM manipulation and traversal without the use of a library like jQuery.

# Author's Motivation
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/houseofleaves/comments/3lqfro/why_is_house_in_blue_see_comment_pls/) is a Reddit post speculating on the motivation behind why the book was stylized this way.
